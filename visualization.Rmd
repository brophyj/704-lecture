##Data visualizations   
Data Visualizations can…      
  
• help understand basic concepts     
• help understand your data      
• clarify your story for others     
• emphasize a message     
• build trust with your audience      
• inform / influence their decisions

```{r echo=TRUE}

g <- ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) + #set data and axes
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") + # add color, could also change "shape" and "size"
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)", 
       title = "Temperatures in Chicago",
       subtitle = "Seasonal pattern of daily temperatures from 1997 to 2001",

##Variability of small numbers!

In a county with 100 people: if 1 kidney cancer death in 1980s, -> 1 / 1000 per decade, among the highest rates    
If no kidney cancer deaths,  rate will be lowest     
Observed rates for smaller counties are much more variable, even if the true cancer probability in these counties is nothing special, probably random fluctuation      
If a large county has a very high rate, more likely a real phenomenon     
--

.large[.red[One Solution]]     
<br>    
**Bayes-estimated county rate** - a weighted average of (a) the observed rate in the county and (b) the national average rate.     
Weights proportional to the population of the county     
Counties with extremely small population the rate is shrunk virtually to the national average    
Counties with moderate population the rate is shrunk part way toward the national average    
Large counties the adjusted rate is essentially equivalent to the observed rate

.red[Answer:] EDA provides much information to answer the question     
• hs troponins do not vary over time    
• hs-troponins are higher in CAD than normals     
• variability of hs-troponins increased in specific subgroups     
• one size fits all threshold level doesn’t seem appropriate     

**Analytical methods (hierarchical models) -> more precision but less transparency**
